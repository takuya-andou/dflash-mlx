## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aryagm/dflash-mlx.git && cd dflash-mlx
uv sync

uv run dflash-mlx --max-new-tokens 128
```

Defaults to Qwen3-4B BF16. First run downloads the target and draft checkpoints into the Hugging Face cache, which is roughly 12 GB for the default pair. Pass `--target-model` and `--draft-model` to override. `dflash-mlx-chat` for interactive chat, `--json` for machine-readable output. Benchmark history is opt-in with `--history` or `--history-file`.

```python
from dflash_mlx import DFlashGenerator

# First run also downloads the default Qwen3-4B target and DFlash draft weights.
runner = DFlashGenerator()
result = runner.generate("Write a quicksort in Python.", max_new_tokens=128)
print(result.text)
```

## Supported models

| Target | Draft |
|---|---|
| `mlx-community/Qwen3-4B-bf16` (default) | `z-lab/Qwen3-4B-DFlash-b16` |
| `mlx-community/Qwen3.5-4B-MLX-bf16` | `z-lab/Qwen3.5-4B-DFlash` |

Qwen3.5 support is functional but incomplete. It is not as fast as the Qwen3 path today because Qwen3.5 uses a more complicated hybrid attention stack with recurrent linear-attention state, so exact partial-block acceptance needs custom cache rollback and currently has weaker long-generation acceptance.

Upstream DFlash has checkpoints for Llama 3.1, Qwen3 Coder, Kimi-K2.5, GPT-OSS, and more in the [Hugging Face collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/z-lab/dflash). Adding a new family starts with an adapter in `dflash_mlx/adapters.py` &mdash; see [ADDING_MODELS.md](ADDING_MODELS.md).

## Qwen3.5 Image API

The `feature/qwen35-image-support` branch includes a small FastAPI server for testing Qwen3.5 image prompts end to end.
The helper script installs the extra runtime packages it needs, including `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, and `python-multipart` for file uploads.

Start it from a fresh machine with:

```bash
git fetch origin feature/qwen35-image-support
git checkout -b feature/qwen35-image-support origin/feature/qwen35-image-support
bash scripts/clone_setup_run_qwen35_image_api.sh
```

Health check:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/healthz
```

Generate from an image URL or server-local path:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/generate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Describe the image.",
    "images": ["https://example.com/example.jpg"],
    "max_new_tokens": 128
  }'
```

Upload a local file with `multipart/form-data`:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/generate-upload" \
  -F 'prompt=Describe the image.' \
  -F 'images=@/absolute/path/to/example.jpg' \
  -F 'max_new_tokens=128'
```

Repeat the `images=@...` field to send multiple images in one request.

## How it works

[DFlash](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06036) trains a small block-diffusion model to propose multiple tokens at once. The target verifies them in a single forward pass and accepts the longest correct prefix &mdash; identical output, fewer forward passes, higher throughput.

The original DFlash targets CUDA. `dflash-mlx` is a native MLX port for Apple Silicon. MLX has no speculative-decoding primitives, so every piece of the draft/verify loop had to be built from scratch on top of Metal:

- **Hidden-state extraction from the target.** DFlash's drafter conditions on intermediate layer activations, not just logits. We hook into specific Qwen layers and surface those tensors without breaking the standard forward path or the KV cache, so a single target pass gives us both verification logits and the hidden states the next draft block needs.

- **Parallel block proposal.** The draft model runs a block-diffusion denoising loop to propose several tokens at once. This runs entirely on the GPU with its own cache, sharing tokenization and positional context with the target.

- **Single-pass batched verification.** Every proposed block is verified in one target forward pass. The target's logits are compared greedily against the draft's samples; we accept the longest matching prefix plus one bonus correction token, which is what makes the output bit-for-bit identical to plain target decoding.

- **Per-layer KV cache rollback on rejection.** When the target rejects the tail of a proposal, the KV cache has to be rewound to the exact accepted length &mdash; per layer, because Qwen3.5 mixes full attention, sliding-window attention, and recurrent linear-attention state, and each has its own cache shape and rollback rule. Plain MLX caches don't expose this; we extend them.

- **Pluggable adapters.** Target-specific concerns (layer ids to tap, cache types, stop tokens, chat template) are isolated in `dflash_mlx/adapters.py`. The core draft/verify loop is architecture-agnostic, so adding a new family is one adapter file rather than a rewrite.

- **Warm-path throughput engineering.** MLX kernel compilation, lazy evaluation, and graph caching all affect the numbers. The bench CLI separates warmup from measurement and pins evaluation points so the reported tok/s reflects steady-state Metal performance, not first-run overhead.
